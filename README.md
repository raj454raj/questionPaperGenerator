questionPaperGenerator
======================

It takes the total marks for the paper to be made. Also the chapters(seperated by hyphen) from which questions should be generated and the number of questions(option for giving questions of 1,2,3,or 4 mark questions in each chapter).
It generates sources to the images of the questions which should be stored in a directory.

What I refer as a category ----> Chapter i, No of marks of the question:j
Assume that every category has 10 questions with their ids starting from 1 to 10.
